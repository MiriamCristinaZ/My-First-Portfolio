1.  About Me
    Let me tell you a bit about myself. I'm a passionate tech enthusiast who's ready for exciting IT adventures. Over the last five years, I've successfully managed a store and worked as a purchasing assistant. But now, I'm diving headfirst into the dynamic world of Information Technology. I'm a junior developer with a knack for manual software testing and a strong appetite for learning. I've recently completed an apprenticeship in software testing and I'm currently immersed in another one to master the art of front-end web development tools.

    Additionally, I've got a solid grasp of Java, and I'm eager to expand my coding repertoire. On top of my tech journey, I hold a degree in Business Accounting with First-Class Honors, demonstrating my commitment to excellence. I'm thrilled about merging my diverse skill set with the ever-evolving tech landscape. Let's connect and explore how I can be a valuable asset to your team or project, bringing fresh perspectives and a thirst for innovation to the table.
